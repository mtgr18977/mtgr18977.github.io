> **Scott Pilgrim faced the insecurities towards their partner that everyone has in a new relationship:** 
>
> - Not being exotic or "different" (Matthew) 
> - Not being famous or cool (Lucas) 
> - Not being morally superior &/or physically gifted (Todd) 
> - Not being the right gender (Roxie) 
> - Not being "enough" (as one person/man) (Katanayagi bros.) 
> - Not being powerful & rich or "in control" (Gideon) 
> - Finally, not being self-confident enough, being paranoid (Nega Scott) He beat them all practically. ]
> - Ramona fought Roxie because sexual orientation is out of someone's control & Scott befriended Nega because you can't fight yourself, you can only accept yourself.
